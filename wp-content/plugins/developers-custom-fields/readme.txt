Provides developers with powerful and flexible tools for managing post and user custom fields.

== Description ==
This plugin is aimed at plugin and theme developers who want a set of tools that allows them to easily and flexibly define custom fields for all post types, and for user profiles.

Please note that this plugin isn't suitable for non-developers. It has been intentionally designed without a user interface for defining fields, and some aspects may be "unfriendly" to anyone not comfortable with hands-on WordPress development.

Here are some similar plugins with interfaces for defining fields.

* [Just Custom Fields](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/just-custom-fields/)
* [Advanced Custom Fields](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/)

Also, if you're a developer and this plugin doesn't quite fit your requirements, one of these might:

* [Easy Custom Fields](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-custom-fields/)
* [Custom Metadata Manager](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/custom-metadata/)
* [WPAlchemy Metabox PHP Class](http://www.farinspace.com/wpalchemy-metabox/)

Please note that I haven't tested these, and can't vouch for their quality.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the `developers-custom-fields` directory into the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Register your boxes and fields with `slt_cf_register_box` (full documentation at [sltaylor.co.uk](http://sltaylor.co.uk/wordpress/plugins/slt-custom-fields/docs/#functions-boxes-fields))

== Getting started ==

Because this code began life just managing custom fields for posts by defining meta boxes for post edit screens, the basic unit here is "the box". However, a "box" can also refer to a section in the user profile screen, or on media attachment edit screens.

A box is defined containing one of more custom fields, each with their own settings. You set a box to be associated with posts (in the generic sense, including pages and custom post types!), users or attachments using the `type` parameter.

Say you've defined `film` as a Custom Post Type, and you want to create custom fields to set the director and writer for film posts. You would add something like this to your theme's functions.php (or indeed your plugin code):

	<?php

	if ( function_exists( 'slt_cf_register_box') )
		add_action( 'init', 'register_my_custom_fields' );

	function register_my_custom_fields() {
		slt_cf_register_box( array(
			'type'		=> 'post',
			'title'		=> 'Credits',
			'id'		=> 'credits-box',
			'context'	=> 'normal',
			'priority'	=> 'high',
			'fields'	=> array(
				array(
					'name'			=> 'director',
					'label'			=> 'Director',
					'type'			=> 'text',
					'scope'			=> array( 'film' ),
					'capabilities'	=> array( 'edit_posts' )
				),
				array(
					'name'			=> 'writer',
					'label'			=> 'Writer',
					'type'			=> 'text',
					'scope'			=> array( 'film' ),
					'capabilities'	=> array( 'edit_posts' )
				)
			)
		));
	}

	?>

Then, when you want to output these values in a loop:

	<?php

	echo '<p>Director: ' . slt_cf_field_value( "director" ) . '</p>';
	echo '<p>Writer: ' . slt_cf_field_value( "writer" ) . '</p>';

	?>

This is just the beginning! Check the [documentation](http://sltaylor.co.uk/wordpress/plugins/slt-custom-fields/docs/) for registering boxes and fields, especially the parameters for fields. The most immediately interesting parameters for fields to check out are: `type`, `scope`, `options_type`.

There are some [option query placeholders](http://sltaylor.co.uk/wordpress/plugins/slt-custom-fields/docs/#placeholders), for creating dynamic queries to populate select, radio and checkbox fields.

There are also a few [hooks](http://sltaylor.co.uk/wordpress/plugins/slt-custom-fields/docs/#hooks). If the plugin currently lacks something you need, odds are you'll be able to hack it using a hook!

If you create a plugin that is dependent on this plugin, use the `slt_cf_init` hook to intialize your plugin (see [this Trac comment](http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11308#comment:7)).

Note that the internal Google Maps and file selection functionality is designed to be leveraged by theme options pages and other plugins.
